# User Constraints and Preferences
## Critical Documentation for All Development Activities

### üö® CRITICAL CONSTRAINT - TERMINOLOGY

#### Prohibited Terms
**NEVER use the term "Institutional" or imply professional/institutional validation**

**Rationale:**
- This is a PERSONAL PROJECT
- "Professional/Advanced" implications are unsubstantiated
- User has explicitly stated this constraint 3+ times across multiple sessions
- Violation represents critical process failure

#### Approved Alternative Terms
- **Personal trading system**
- **Advanced strategy**
- **Enhanced approach**
- **Optimized system**
- **Professional-grade** (when referring to code quality only)

#### Compliance Requirements
1. **All agents must validate** terminology before use
2. **Context manager must track** constraint violations
3. **Quality gates must include** terminology compliance
4. **Agile coach must monitor** constraint adherence

### üîç Validation Protocol

#### Before Any Development Work
1. **Review this constraints document**
2. **Validate terminology choices**
3. **Confirm alignment with personal project scope**
4. **Check for constraint compliance**

#### During Development
1. **Continuous constraint monitoring**
2. **Real-time validation of language choices**
3. **Context manager oversight**
4. **Agile coach process monitoring**

#### After Development
1. **Final constraint compliance review**
2. **Terminology audit**
3. **Quality gate validation**
4. **Documentation review**

### üìä Violation Tracking

#### Historical Violations
1. **Session 1:** Initial "Professional/Advanced" terminology usage
2. **Session 2:** Continued "Professional/Advanced" language despite feedback
3. **Session 3:** Current session - explicit constraint documentation required

#### Process Improvements
- **Constraint-first workflows** implemented
- **Enhanced context management** for constraint tracking
- **Quality gate enhancement** with constraint validation
- **Agile process integration** for proactive monitoring
