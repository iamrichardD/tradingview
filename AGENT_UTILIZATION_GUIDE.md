## Best Practices & Coordination Protocols

### Multi-Agent Communication Standards

#### **Context Handoff Protocol**
```
Agent A → Clear Summary + Relevant Files → Agent B
```

**Required Elements:**
- Current status and completed work
- Key decisions and constraints
- Next steps and expectations
- Relevant file paths and documentation

#### **Quality Gate Integration**
Each agent transition must meet defined quality criteria:

**Development Quality Gates:**
- **Fletcher → Seldon**: Complete context and requirements gathered
- **Seldon → Herbie**: Clear project plan with defined tasks
- **Herbie → Artoo**: Workflow optimized with clear next steps
- **Artoo → Chopper**: Code complete with ≥90% test coverage
- **Chopper → Ford**: All tests passing with validation complete

**Content Quality Gates:**
- **Fletcher → Seth**: Research complete with source materials identified
- **Seth → Ford**: Comprehensive outline with brand guidelines
- **Ford → Athena**: Draft complete with visual requirements specified
- **Athena → Delivery**: Final content with professional design integration

### Conflict Resolution Framework

#### **Priority Hierarchy**
1. **Strategic Tier**: project-manager, agile-coach (final decision authority)
2. **Domain Expertise**: Specialized agents have authority in their domains
3. **Quality Standards**: Technical standards override convenience
4. **User Requirements**: User specifications take precedence over agent preferences

#### **Escalation Process**
```
Domain Conflict → Herbie (agile-coach) → Seldon (project-manager) → User
```

#### **Resolution Patterns**
- **Technical Disputes**: Framework-specific experts (Ripley) provide final guidance
- **Quality Standards**: Testing agents (Chopper) enforce quality gates
- **Content Disputes**: Strategic content agents (Seth) define brand consistency
- **Process Issues**: Herbie mediates and optimizes workflow

### Performance Optimization Strategies

#### **Agent Selection Efficiency**
- **Single Domain**: Use 1-2 specialized agents
- **Cross-Domain**: Include coordination agents (Herbie)
- **Complex Projects**: Full ecosystem with strategic planning (Seldon)

#### **Context Management**
- **Fletcher First**: Always establish context before specialization
- **Minimize Handoffs**: Reduce agent transitions for simple tasks  
- **Batch Related Work**: Group similar tasks for single agents
- **Clear Dependencies**: Define prerequisites before starting workflows

#### **Resource Allocation**
- **Peak Efficiency**: 3-4 agents for most projects
- **Coordination Overhead**: Add Herbie for 5+ agent projects
- **Strategic Planning**: Include Seldon for multi-week initiatives
- **Quality Assurance**: Always include domain-appropriate testing agents
