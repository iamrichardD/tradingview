```

### Error Handling & Validation
```pinescript
// Input Validation

    valid = true
    valid := valid and atrPeriod > 0
    valid := valid and riskPerTrade > 0 and riskPerTrade <= 10
    valid := valid and confluenceRequired >= 1 and confluenceRequired <= 7
    valid

// Edge Case Handling
calculatePositionSize(entryPrice, stopLoss) =>
    if na(entryPrice) or na(stopLoss)
        0.0
    else
        stopDistance = math.abs(entryPrice - stopLoss)
        if stopDistance <= 0
            0.0
        else
            riskAmount = strategy.equity * (riskPerTrade / 100)
            math.max(riskAmount / stopDistance, 1.0)
```
