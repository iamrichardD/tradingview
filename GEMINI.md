## Project Context Files

To gain a comprehensive understanding of the project's goals, conventions, and existing work, please review the following files upon starting a session:

1.  **`CLAUDE.md`**: This file contains high-level project goals and notes originally intended for the Claude AI. It provides essential background.
2.  **`claude-instructions.md`**: This file contains specific instructions and conventions that were previously established. Please adhere to these unless they conflict with your core mandates.
3.  **All `README.md` files**: Each module and sub-directory contains a `README.md` file that explains its specific purpose and usage. Please recursively find and read all `README.md` files to understand the structure and functionality of different parts of the codebase.

By reviewing these documents, you will be better equipped to assist with development tasks in a way that is consistent with the project's established patterns.
